## Renai

### Overview

**Renai,** a Chat with PDF app allows users to upload and interact with an AI that can understand and answer questions based on the content of the uploaded PDFs. This app is designed to help users (specifically college users) quickly get information from large documents, manuals, research papers through an interactive chat experience.

### Problem
In my university, students struggle with understanding and retaining large amounts of course material. Basically there are large amount of course materials, all scattered everywhere. This issue is because of the lack of personalized study aids. Because of this, many students find it difficult to efficiently review their notes, ask relevant questions, and get clear explanations tailored to their specific needs.

### Solution
Renai addresses this issue by converting course material (PDFs) into chat conversations. It allows students to upload course materials and ask questions based on those materials. This makes studying more interactive, accessible, and tailored to individual learning needs, thereby improving comprehension and academic performance.
